# Bet Racing Game Project "Bet The Best"

## 1. Introduction
- This project is a development of a `racing betting game` using `Python` programming language.

- Players take on the role of bettors. They choose a character to bet on and place bets on rounds, not on characters.

- If the player's chosen character finishes in the top 3, the player wins. In other cases, the player loses.

- If the player wins, they will receive a prize based on the bet amount and the finishing position. Conversely, if the player loses, they will be penalized (deducted money).

## 2. Usage

Run the program from the `login.py` file in the `game` directory (other files are imported in this file).

## 3. Requirements

- `pygame`
- `json`
- `opencv (cv2)`
- `face_recognition`
- `numpy`
- `smtplib`
- `pytesseract`
- `pillow`

## 5. Acknowledgements

Group 4 - 23CTT1A FIT@HCMUS would like to express our sincere gratitude to ***Mr. Vo Hoang Quan*** for giving us the opportunity to experience and practice developing a game product in the first semester of our very first year at University of Science. Throughout this project, we were able to gain more experience in teamwork, programming skills, and familiarity with a new programming language.
